My expectations in CMSC 100:
Personally, I struggled with CMSC 22 which is a pre requisite of this course. I expect for this
course to be challenging as well but I will do my best to do all activities and for me to complete
this course. Lastly, I expect this class to be fun despite the struggles that I may face in the
upcoming classes.

opinion: I agree with your expectations. I kind of struggled too with CMSC 22 and I am hoping that we survive and pass this course at ease. I am hoping that all will be fine as well!
